title: You don't start out writing good stuff
description: the what's and whys of what we try to achieve

No one starts out writing good stuff. 
Almost everything that is great in this world, starts from something humble. 
A mighty river begins as a small stream.
An life form begins as a single cell.
A trillion dollar dollar company begins from someone's garage.

And we begin, Here.

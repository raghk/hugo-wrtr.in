Why? Why am I doing this? Why are you doing this? Why is everyone doing this? Why? Why?

You’re clueless, right? So am I.

But let me share my perspective and insight with you on this. It is something that I have learned so far. I’ll also neatly categorize it so you can cherry-pick the stuff that suits you, and we’ll sit and cry together. E-crying is also okay if we aren’t next to each other.

**1. Loneliness**

I think this is something that most of us can relate to, we’re lonely and we don’t know what to do next. Meanwhile, you have annoying little ‘tings’ that keep bombarding your brain coupled with corny captions to make you tap on that banner and empty your wallet. I can proudly tell you that I’ve never fallen prey to their dastardly tricks. But when it’s post lunch or dinner time, it’s kind of how during the olden days the hands used to reach for alcohol automatically. I get it, people led a simple lifestyle, and post work, they didn’t have all these fancy pubs and 50% off on dining and delivery shit. It was spending time with your family and then straight to bed. Heck, there was no such thing as dinner back then. We copied it from the west because we wanted to look cool. Do you still remember how one entire village wasted money on celebrations when Kamala Harris became the Vice-President of the United States? Yeah, same. She would have probably laughed her guts off when she heard this.

I’m digressing. Where were we? Ah, loneliness, the B word. Yeah. right.

**2. Boredom.**

Bored. Ah, I’m bored. What do I do now? Let me call my frie.. Never mind. Let me send a text. Oh, I’ll probably hear back from him/her sometime around 2050. Exaggerating? No, I’m not. I’m being honest here. I’m also taking a subtle dig at my friends who don’t respond to my texts on time. Ehehehe.. You know who you guys are :P.

Where were we? Boredom. Yes. You/me order unnecessary stuff from these two buggers just because we are bored. Dopamine high? Wait, is it endorphins? I sucked at Chemistry and I failed miserably. I am also too lazy to go on Google and find out what it is. Can someone find an app that can get this done for me? Please?. No? Okay fine. Keep your secrets to ye’ self. Pfffft.

**3. Home-cooked food sucks.**

I’ll probably have shoes and sticks thrown at me by people who live away from their hometowns. HOW DARE YOU? (Hi, Greta). Yeah yeah, I am the recipient of some nice and hot home-cooked food dished out by my ageing mother who makes sure I eat every morsel of it. Yes, I’m one of those lucky fellows who still work in the city they were born in. Okay, enough flexing. Sorry If I had made anyone feel bad.

My friends used to question me a lot when I tell them that outside food is the bomb. They used to taste the food cooked by my mum and say “Dude, this is so friggin’ tasty and you have the nerve to say outside food tastes better? Something is wrong with you.

I think something is indeed wrong with me. Next.

**4. I’m running out of ideas.**

Yeah, I think I’m running out of ideas and about to hit writer’s block. But yeah, these are the solid reasons that I can think of as to why I order food from outside and eat and then regret why on earth did I spend all that monies on eating out when I could have done something else with that.

Back to the pavilion. Hey, where’s that chilly chicken? How much is tha… 500.. Wha? Okay.

“Ting”

Oh, you’re still here. Bye bye.

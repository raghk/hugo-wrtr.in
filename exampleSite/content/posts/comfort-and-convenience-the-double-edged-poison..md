It has a slight relation to my previous post, the multiverse. Yes, I will also use that term loosely now. 

If you are too lazy to go and read back the first post, then that is fine. It is fine. No, I think it is not fine please go read it okay thanks. 

Hmmmmm. 

Hmmm. 

Hm. 

Comfort and “kon-veeeni-yons” (Jim from The Office). Where are we on that now? 10-minute deliveries, 10-second deliveries…. 10 nano sec… okay wait I think I am taking it too far now.

You get my point? Is this necessary? Is this demand created artificially by a bunch of people who have to show that they are doing ‘something’ to their investors? 

Guess we’ll never know. 

But you and I know this. This so-called comfort and convenience are doing us no good. 

Why? One word. All this has made us lazy. Yeah yeah yeah I get it I get it, “There’s no time, I bet you’re a privileged piece of shit who has all the time in the world whereas we are all slogging it off 24/7 having no time to even breathe”. 

No. I. am. Not. privileged. But I got it nicely from a friend who is elder than me in age, she just told me this “You start working for a corporate company, then you’ll know”. There is some truth to it. I am not denying that. I completely empathize with the working class. I am also part of one. 

But, in our zeal to earn more dough, buy big McMansions and flashy cars from the money we don’t have to impress people that we don’t even like, all of us are running this rat race with an infinite path loop. Where does it end? There’s the twist. It doesn’t have an end. 

Our ancestors used to fight wild-ass animals with their bare hands, and be on the move almost the entire day under the sun. Their life used to look like this 

Wake up around 4 am, off to the fields… work until afternoon, and come back home for lunch... Take some rest... Wake up in the evening, get some work done, come back home and then it was lights off at 7 pm max. No TVs, soaps, nightlife and so on. 

Note : I was not alive back then and am not sure of how their schedule would have been. Just shooting in the dark. 

Life was simple.  
Now it is not. 

It was either due to the compulsion of time or artificially created demand and luxuries. Well, some are useful, no denying that. But I hope I have gotten my point across. 

All of us have gotten lazy due to our circumstances and situations and is the main reason for all sorts of health problems. To put it even more bluntly, these guys are making money off our inabilities and time constraints. It isn’t going to help us in the long run and there would only be one beneficiary. 

Tell you what. It might be difficult, next time, try paying a visit to your local Kirana store, greet the owner who sits at the counter with a smile, buy your essentials and go home. Let me know that feels. 

P.S. Yes, the guy who sits at the shop counter also needs to get some exercise. Do tell him that. BUT. If you see a flying utensil or some UFO hurtling towards you at warp speed because of the above statement, you cannot hold me responsible. 

Also adding the disclaimer, “Try this at your own risk”. 

Bye.

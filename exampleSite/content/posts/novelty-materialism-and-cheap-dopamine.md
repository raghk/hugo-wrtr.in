Instant gratification. You would have heard this term everywhere by now.

What is it?

Instant gratification is **the desire to experience pleasure or fulfilment without delay or deferment**. It is when you want it, and you want it now. Instant gratification is the opposite of what we've been taught and try too hard to practice — delayed gratification.

Take a step back and pause for a brief moment. Look around you. What do you see?

1\. Social Media

2\. People selling stuff

3\. Do this, do that

4\. Subscribe to this

5\. Buy this

The list goes on.

It is called [cheap dopamine](https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=1a4075a19d846d04eb2ac8f89&id=e64f42c825). The term is pretty self-explanatory; cheap stuff fucks up your life.

We are driven by cheap dopamine today. Instant joy, instant fun, and instant escape from the reality of life.

I don’t know why or how we got here. Capitalism, crony capitalism? I don’t know, pick something. But it has something to do with capitalism. I’m sure.

I recently read an article on LinkedIn about how copywriting in ads has lost its sheen. Reason; attention span. No, nothing wrong with our attention span. It is just that now too many things are vying for it and has become a cut-throat business/competition of who gets your attention span to sell you shit you do not need to impress people that you do not like. (Yeah, fight club).

Buying those latest headphones, the latest laptop, or even the latest phone for that reason. The novelty will stay around until you unbox it and use it for a few days. No matter how hard you try, you can never bring that wow feeling/factor back. It’s not coming back. No.

For example, I’m currently using an iPhone SE 2020 that I bought in June 2020. I got brutally trolled on a tech forum for buying something that was outdated in their opinion. The phone’s casing was a bit dated, yeah. But what was under the hood was mind blowing for that time. 3.2 Gigzaillion dinosaur MH3040 processor and 1 trillion MB of RAM on it to open up WhatsApp and talk shit or go to Instagram and watch what other people are doing and embark on a trip that will end up making you feel like shit. Wow, this is like paying money to enter this shitshow.

2 and a half years later, the only thing that needs is a battery change. I was itching to get the iPhone 14 Pro, but 1.4 lakhs for what joy? Unless and until my phone has broken down and is considered vintage in Apple’s terminology, I won't be getting myself a new phone.

Remember when eating out used to be a luxury for all of us? That feeling used to be so special. Our parents/family will inform us in advance or the day that we are going out for dinner. Remember putting on fresh clothes, those flashy shoes, basically dressing up in the best way you can. Then comes the drive to the restaurant/hotel in that minimal traffic we had 20 years ago. Enter the restaurant, be seated, order what is on the menu and finally wait for your food to reach your table. More than eating the food, these little things brought so much of joy for all of us. It was something cool. It felt nice.

Now, wearing torn clothes, not worried about our appearance, Ding-Dong! Approach your house door like you are some outsider, quickly snatch the packet from the delivery guy, staring at him awkwardly with that half-assed smile, “Th..thaan u”. The guy is nowhere the next second.

You go inside your room, Flip through Prime or Netflix trying to find that perfect TV show or movie where your food starts to think “The fuck is this fool doing?”

Throw the containers into the dustbin and off to bed. Eat, sleep, repeat.

**It sucks big time.**

No, I will not tell you how to deal with this. There are 1000s of sites that can do this for you.

The point of this post was to share how the world and times have changed. We are running behind those big paychecks, big designations for what? To provide for our family, of course. Whatever is going on right now is just artificially created ; Artificial demand, artificial scarcity etc.

_(With all due respect to those who are working hard to make ends meet, upgrade to a better lifestyle, etc.)_

The endpoint, cheap dopamine, novelty and materialism isn't going to help you in any way. If you think you can relate to what I have just said, take a step back and look around.  
  
You will be amazed by the discovery.
